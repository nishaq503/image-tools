# Binary Operations Plugin (v0.5.1-dev0)

This WIPP plugin does Morphological Image Processing on binary and instance labelled images.
The operations available are:

  * #### Inversion

      This operation inverts binary images.  The 0s get mapped to 1 and the 1s get mapped to 0.
      Can only be applied to binary images.

  * #### Dilation

      This operation increases the white region in the image, or the foreground object increases.

  * #### Erosion

      This operation decreases the white region in the image, or the foreground object decreases.

  * #### Opening

      An opening operation is similar to applying an erosion followed by a dilation.  It removes small objects/noise in the background of the images.

  * #### Closing

      A closing operation is similar to applying a dilation following by an erosion.  It is useful in closing small holes inside the foreground object, or small
      black points inside the image

  * #### Morphological Gradient

      This operation is the difference between dilation and erosion of an image.  It creates an outline of the foreground object

  * #### Filling Holes

      This function fills in the foreground object.  It finds countours in the object and fills it with black and inverts it back.

  * #### Skeletonization

      This operation reduces the foreground regions to a skeletal remnant that largely preserves the extent and connectivity of the original region while throwing away most of the original foreground pixels.

  * #### Top Hat

      This operation is the difference between the input image and opening of the image.

  * #### Black Hat

      This operation is the difference between the input image and closing of the image.

   * #### Area Filtering

      There are two types of area filtering available.
      1) Remove segments that are larger than an area specified.
      2) Remove segments that are smaller than an area specified.
      A threshold needs to be defined to run this operation.
